<p>Dear <%= @applicant.firstname %>, </p>

<p>Thank you for applying to Meet & Multiply. You profile is a great fit for the types of partners <%= @originator.title %> is hoping to meet and we would love to have you at the event. </p>

<p>Please confirm your participation by June 24th at the latest. </p>

<p>We will also need a photo of you and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator.title %>. Please review the section called <%= link_to "What we are looking for in potential partners", originator_url(@originator) %> and take that into consideration for your bio. The photo and bio will be used in an overview of the participants, which will be distributed to the event attendees. </p>

<p>Please note that all activities of the event will take place in English. You can see the agenda for the event here: <a href="http://www.meetandmultiply.org/agenda.pdf">www.meetandmultiply.org/agenda.pdf.</a></p>
