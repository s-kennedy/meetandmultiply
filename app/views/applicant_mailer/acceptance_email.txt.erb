Dear <%= @applicant.firstname %>, 

Thank you for applying to Meet & Multiply. You profile is a great fit for the types of partners <%= @originator.title %> is hoping to meet and we would love to have you at the event. 

Please confirm your participation by June 19th at the latest. 

We will also need a photo and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator.title %>. Please review the section called <%= link_to "What we are looking for in potential partners", originator_url(@originator) %> and take that into consideration for your bio. The photo and bio will be used in an overview of the participants, which will be distributed to the event attendees. 

You can see the agenda for the event here: http://www.meetandmultiply.org/agenda.pdf. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing you on June 29th. 

Regards, 

Sharon Kennedy
