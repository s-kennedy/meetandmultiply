Dear <%= @applicant.firstname %>, 

I haven't heard back from you yet about your participation at Meet & Mulitply. Did you receive the acceptance email we sent you? 

We would love to have you at the event. Please confirm your particicpation today if you plan to come.

We will also need a photo of you and a short bio. This should be no more than 250 words and it should focus on how you fit the Adopter profile for <%= @originator.title %>. Please review the section called <%= link_to "What we are looking for in potential partners", originator_url(@originator) %> and take that into consideration for your bio. The photo and bio will be used in the event programme, which will be distributed to the event attendees. If you want to be in the programme, send me your bio and photo by the end of the day today.

Could you send me your phone number in case we need to follow up on any information with you? 

Feel free to contact me if you have any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing you on June 29th. 

Regards, 

Sharon Kennedy
Meet & Multiply
